26. Elroy-Sparta State Trail,0,"Wisconsin’s Elroy-Sparta State Trail was the first rail-to-trail conversion in the country. Running 34 miles between Elroy and Sparta, the trail passes through wetlands, prairies, farmland and unglaciated areas. Birding is always good along the trail. The three century-old railroad tunnels highlight the trip. On its west end, a bridge over I-90 at Sparta connects the Elroy-Sparta to the La Crosse River State Trail. On its eastern end, the Elroy-Sparta connects to the 400 State Trail at the Elroy Commons. Juneau County’s Omaha Trail goes north from Elroy to Camp Douglas. <br><br>Phone: 608/462-2410 <br><br>Web: www.elroy-sparta-trail.com <br><br>Signature species: Meadowlark, Bobolink & Eastern Bluebird <br><br>Rare species: Carolina Wren & Lark Sparrow <br><br>Gazetteer: Page 42, C-1 <br><br>Seasonality: Open year round <br><br>Parking: Parking lots <br><br>Nearest food & lodging: Kendall or Elroy <br><br>Fee: Trail fees apply",-90.27637500000,43.74493300000
