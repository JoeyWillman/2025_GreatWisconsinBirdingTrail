### Final Proposal
1. Persona/Scenario
    1. Persona
        This project is aimed at Birders, Hikers, or any individual looking to explore the natural areas of Wisconsin. This site should help individuals explore the different sites included in the Great Wisconsin          Birding and Nature Trail (https://dnr.wisconsin.gov/topic/EndangeredResources/birdtrail) and give them enough information to decide where they want to visit.
    2. Scenario
        The user hears about the Great Wisconsin Birding and Nature Trail and is interested in exploring sites near them. They come across a link for this interactive map and decide to check it out. When the page          loads they are presented with five options: Lake Superior Northwoods Region, Mississippi/Chipewa Rivers Region, Lake Michigan, Southern Savanna, and Central Sand Prairie. The user is from the Milwaukee             area, so they click on the Lake Michigan option to explore sites close to their house. Upon clicking on the card, the site opens up a map with 64 points covering 11 counties. As the user hovers his mouse           over a county it is highlighted prompting the user to click on it. A small description pops up highlihgting hotspots in the county. The user hovers his mouse over one of the points and is brought to a page         that has a map, description, directions, and bird/wildlife info.
