southern-savannah,Columbia,"In the heart of south-central Wisconsin, Columbia
County’s most prominent terrain feature is the Wisconsin
River, which forms a portion of its western border. The
river scribes a long, sweeping curve through the county
from Wisconsin Dells in the north to Lake Wisconsin in
the south.
Wisconsin Dells is an epicenter of Wisconsin
tourism. It sells fun – creates and packages fun in a mil-
lion ways. If you like roller coasters, duck rides on the
river, championship golf, waterparks (indoors and out),
bungee jumping, world-class spas, or any other imaginable family
amusement, you’ll love the Dells. (www.wisdells.com, 800/223-3557)
Portage, the county seat, is one of the most historically significant
places in the state. Here, the Wisconsin River nearly meets the Fox
River flowing south from Green Bay. The Portage Canal linked the
two rivers creating a water route from the Great Lakes to the
Mississippi River. In the early 1800s, Fort Winnebago protected this
vital transportation link. The Surgeon’s Quarters of the original fort
can still be toured (www.portagewi.com, 608/742-2949) as well as the
Historic Indian Agency House (www.portagewi.com, 608/742-
6362).
To the south, the MacKenzie Environmental Center near
Poynette offers birding opportunities on their several miles of trails as
well as an observation tower, an exhibit of live Wisconsin wildlife,
museums and a picnic area (www.mackenziecenter.com, 608/635-

southern-savannah,Dodge,"Any birder worth their binoculars knows that Dodge
County is the home of the Horicon National
Wildlife Refuge – the largest freshwater cattail
marsh in the country. It is one of the continent’s best
bird watching destinations attracting 270 avian
species each year.
The marsh’s 32,000 acres are managed in two
sections: the northern 21,000 acres by the US Fish &
Wildlife Service (www.fws.gov/midwest/horicon,
920/387-2658), and the southern 11,000 acres by the Wisconsin DNR

southern-savannah,Green,"Green County says “Willkommen” in so many ways.
Amid the county’s rolling hills, Swiss emigrants from
the Canton of Glarus first settled in 1845. Of course,
they named their community New Glarus. Today, New
Glarus bills itself as America’s “Little Switzerland.” The
Swiss heritage here manifests itself in the architecture,
the music, the folk art, the beer and the cheese –
above all, the cheese.
For a craft-brewing bonanza, tour the New Glarus
Brewing Co. and sample their “Spotted Cow,” (www.newglarus-
brewing.com, 608/527-5850). Downtown, the Swiss Historical
Village Museum displays the area’s pioneer life and Swiss heritage in
fourteen historic buildings (www.swisshistoricalvillage.org, 608/527-
2317). Just south of town, New Glarus Woods State Park offers
32 family campsites (www.wiparks.net, 608/527-2335) as well as

River into Iowa County to three of the state’s most pop-
ular attractions. Frank Lloyd Wright’s Taliesin Visitor
Center is the start of tours to the famed architect’s
Wisconsin home (877/588-7900, www.taliesinpreserva-
tion.org). Just to the east on Golf Course Road,
American Players Theatre performs a summer season
of Shakespeare and other classics in an outdoor
amphitheater (608/588-2361,
www.playinthewoods.org). A few miles further south
on Hwy 23 is the House on the Rock, Wisconsin’s most popular sin-
gle attraction – an eclectic collection of fantasy and imagination
(800/947-2799, www.thehouseontherock.com).
Dodgeville, the county seat, preserves its history with its elegant,
but unpretentious county courthouse. Built in 1859, it is the oldest
courthouse still in use in the state. Three miles north of the city,

War-era Italianate mansion (608/987-2884, www.mineralpoint.com)."
southern-savannah,Jefferson,"Smaller than most, Jefferson County is large in fun
things to do and see.
If you like to bike, the Glacial Drumlin State Trail
transects Jefferson County east-to-west (920/648-8774,
www.wiparks.net). This 52-mile railbed trail runs from
Waukesha to Cottage Grove, a Madison suburb. Nearly
half the trail is in Jefferson County.
In western Jefferson County, Lake Mills straddles the
Glacial Drumlin State Trail. This charming Victorian com-
munity also graces the shores of Rock Lake. Nearby,
Aztalan State Park is one of the most important archeological sites
in the state – a stockaded village of the Middle Mississippian Indian
culture (920/648-8774, www.wiparks.net). The Aztalan Museum,
near the park, offers a pioneer village museum with log and brick
churches, 1840’s cabins and a school (920/648-4632).

city is best known as the home of the popular Fireside Dinner
Theatre, staging five professional musicals each year (800/477-9505,
www.firesidetheatre.com)"
southern-savannah,Lafayette,"Lafayette County lies within the unglaciated area of
Wisconsin in the driftless region bordering the State of
Illinois. With an area of 643 square miles, it has a popu-
lation of just over 16,000.
The first European settlers came here in 1824 to
work the area’s many surface lead mines. Lafayette
County was formed in 1847 when the Legislature divid-
ed Iowa County into two separate counties. The
Southern portion became Lafayette County, named after
Marquis de Lafayette, hero of the Revolutionary War.
While agriculture is the county’s leading enterprise, recreation and
tourism are growing. The Cheese Country Trail and other club trails
welcome horse, ATV and snowmobile riders. The eastern half of the
county includes some excellent cold-water trout streams.
Yellowstone Lake State Park in the northeastern corner of the
county is a popular destination with 128 family campsites, good fish-
ing and a nice swimming beach (608/523-4427, www.wiparks.net).
In the northwest corner of the county, tiny Belmont was the
state’s First Capitol for one session of the territorial legislature in
1836 (608/987-2122, www.firstcapitol.org). The site’s two modest
frame buildings once housed the legislature and the supreme court.
To the south, tour the Badger Mine & Museum in Shullsburg where
you can descend 51 steps into a lead mine hand-dug in 1827
(608/965-4424, www.shullsburgwisconsin.org)."
southern-savannah,Richland,"Bordered on the south by the Wisconsin River, Richland
County is a maze of ridgelines and valleys. This is the
driftless area of Wisconsin – a corner of the state not
bulldozed by the last great Wisconsin glacier.
Creeks and streams and rivers drain the valleys of
Richland County. Most are spring-fed, cold-water
streams that hold brown and brook trout. Their names
are as colorful as their fish: Gault Hollow Creek, John
Hill Creek, Dieter Hollow Creek and Fancy Creek to
name but a few of dozens. This is fly-fishing heaven where you can
literally fish a different creek every week of the season.
Richland Center is the county seat. The Starlite 14 Drive-In
Theater is one of only a few outdoor theaters left in Wisconsin (608-
647-3669). Downtown, the Valley Antique Mall offers three floors
of antiques and collectibles, displayed by more than 30 dealers
(608/647-3793). Also downtown, the Court Street Commercial
Historic District encompasses 69 buildings in the ten-block area
around Court Street.
Krouskop Park, off Hwy 14 on the city’s northwest side, includes
an excellent 9-hole disc golf course with some tightly wooded holes
and slight elevation. On the Pine River Recreation Trail, you can
take a lazy bike ride up a lazy river – 15.8 miles from Richland Center
to Lone Rock on a gentle railbed trail (800/422-1318, www.richland-
chamber.com). Along the way you’ll cross 15 bridges that span the
meandering Pine and its tributaries. One bridge is a whopping 241
feet long. Town Parks in Gotham and Lone Rock offer pleasant rest
stops."
southern-savannah,Rock,"The Rock River is the single, dominant terrain feature of
Rock County. It flows south out of Lake Koshkonong to
the Illinois border, bisecting the county and its two largest
cities, Janesville and Beloit.
With 2,000 acres of scenic parkland along the river,
Janesville is truly “Wisconsin’s Park Place.” A visitor
favorite is the Rotary Gardens, a 20-acre internationally
themed botanical garden (608/752-3885, www.rotarygar-
dens.org). Nearly twenty percent of Wisconsin’s buildings
listed on the National Register of Historic Places can be
found in Janesville, including the Lincoln-Tallman House, a 26-room
Italianate-style mansion where President Lincoln once slept (800/577-
1859, www.rchs.us). On Wednesday and Sunday evenings in summer,

southern-savannah,Sauk,"The Wisconsin River forms the southern, and much of
the eastern border of Sauk County from Wisconsin
Dells/Lake Delton in the county’s northeastern cor-

central-sands,Adams,"When the last great glacier swept through Wisconsin
12,000 years ago leveling much of the Midwest, it
spared the southwestern corner of the state including
Adams County.
Consequently, the county’s landscape is graced by
many fanciful spires, buttes and mesas that were once
islands in Glacial Lake Wisconsin. Native Americans and
their European successors gave these solitary pinnacles
colorful names like Ship Rock, Friendship Mound, Rabbit
Rock, Roche-A-Cri, and Lone Rock.
As the glacier retreated, its meltwater carved the state’s lakes and
rivers, including the Wisconsin River that forms the western border of
Adams County. That border includes two large impounded lakes on
the Wisconsin River – Petenwell Lake and the Castle Rock Flowage. At
23,040 and 13,955 acres respectively, the lakes are the second the
fifth largest in Wisconsin. The lakes are havens of water recreation
offering quality walleye fishing and plenty of water for all types of
boating.
Near Friendship, the county seat, you can visit Roche-A-Cri State
Park (608/339-6881, www.wiparks.net). The French name refers to
the 300-foot-high rock outcropping that is the central feature of this
quiet park. Climb the stairway to the top for a spectacular panoramic
view. The park contains Native American pictographs (rock paintings)
and Petroglyphs (rock carvings) that date to 100 A.D., as well as 41
family campsites and 6 miles of hiking trails."
central-sands,Calumet,"Occupying much of the eastern shore of Lake
Winnebago, Wisconsin’s largest inland lake, Calumet
County is a beautiful landscape of rolling farms broken
by panoramic limestone cliffs and wetlands teeming
with wildlife. Friendly small towns and eco-tourism
bring travelers back again and again.
The county’s most prominent geologic feature is
the Niagara Escarpment, a low line of dolomitic lime-
stone bluffs that rises above the countryside. One of
several ancient ridges in the bedrock of the Great Lakes Basin, the
Niagara Escarpment begins in New York State, arches west over Lake
Huron into Michigan’s Upper Peninsula, then down through Door
County to the Wisconsin-Illinois border.
You can camp atop the escarpment at High Cliff State Park near
Sherwood, (920/989-1106, www.wiparks.net). The park offers 112
family campsites, 10 miles of mountain bike trails, Indian effigy
mounds and a terrific beach and marina on Lake Winnebago. The
park is particularly lovely in autumn when the fall colors play against
the bluffs.
To learn more about the area’s geology, flora and fauna, visit the
Ledge View Nature Center near Chilton, the county seat (920/849-
7094, www.co.calumet.wi.us). This 105-acre park includes a 60-foot

Neillsville, in the southern part of the county, is the county seat. It
offers a pair of unusual museums and a beautiful veterans’ memorial
park.
The 1897 Jail Museum, an imposing four-story brick building

central-sands,Green Lake,"The landscape of Green Lake County is dominated by a
pair of large and divergent lakes – Green Lake and Lake
Puckaway.
Green Lake is one of the state’s deepest lakes.
Plunging 237 feet, the cool waters of this 7,300-acre
lake harbor an excellent lake trout and walleye fishery.
Lake Puckaway, on the other hand, is very shallow; just
3 feet deep on average and only 5 feet at its deepest.
At 5,000-acres, Puckaway is more lowland marsh than
lake, yet fishing is good and waterfowl are common.
The City of Green Lake has been a top tourism destination for more
than a century. The lake is the key attraction and the area’s resort offer-
ings include water sports of every kind. One of those resorts, the Heidel
House, operates The Escapade, a 60-foot, catamaran-style boat that
tours the lake (800/444-2812, www.heidelhouse.com). The Green Lake
area is also known nationally for its three excellent golf courses –

west/necedah). Whooping Cranes, Sandhill Cranes and
Trumpeter Swans call Necedah home, as do gray wolves
and Karner blue butterflies.
The central third of Juneau County, between I-90/94
and Hwy. 21, is farm field and lowland forest drained by
the Yellow and Lemonweir Rivers. To the east, Buckhorn
State Park occupies 7,000 acres on the shores of Castle

The southern third of the county, below I-90/94, is riddled with
hills and valleys, part of southwestern Wisconsin’s “driftless” area
untouched by the glaciers. It boasts three terrific railbed bike trails.

central-sands,Marathon,"Marathon is Wisconsin’s largest county covering 1,545
square miles. It is largely agricultural land. Marathon
County dairy farmers place second in the state for total
milk production and for number of dairy herds.
Interestingly, Marathon County leads the nation and the
world in the production of dry ginseng root. Most is
exported to China.
The county is neatly bisected by the Wisconsin River.
A workhorse for the paper industry, the river provides
water for mills in Wausau, Rothschild and Mosinee in Marathon
County. Dams built for the paper industry on the river created the Big
Eau Pleine Reservoir and Lake DuBay, which today give the county its
recreational flavor.
Wausau, the county seat, is the home of the Leigh Yawkey
Woodson Art Museum, nationally renowned for it annual Birds in
Art exhibit (715/845-7010, www.lywam.org). If you’re wondering

5750, www.marathoncountyhistory.com)."
central-sands,Marquette,"Marquette County boasts a single stoplight in the entire
county – 455 square miles and very little traffic.
The county is named for Father Jacques Marquette,
the French explorer who paddled down the Fox River
into the area in 1673. The European settlers who fol-
lowed him dammed the river at Montello creating
Buffalo Lake, an important link in the Fox-Wisconsin
waterway. Today, the lake is a ten-mile crescent of fish-
ing and boating; the recreational heart of the county.
Montello, the county seat, is a pleasant small town once famous
for its granite quarry. The extraordinarily hard, red granite was
shipped nationwide and was used in the tombs of both Ulysses Grant
and Robert E. Lee. You can still see the quarry from the city’s Quarry
Park on Main Street. The park includes three small waterfalls that
once powered the quarry’s drills and saws.
In southern Marquette County near Packwaukee, you can make a
reservation to tour Bison Ridge Ranch (608-589-5500, www.bison-
ridgeranch.com). Nearly 300 bison roam the ranch. Ninety-minute

central-sands,Menominee,"Wisconsin’s Menominee County is actually the
Menominee Indian Reservation. The reservation
totals 234,000 acres and is home to about 4,000
tribal members. At one time, the Menominee occupied
most of central Wisconsin – more than 10 million acres.
The Menominee have lived here for more than 10,000
years and have a proud history. They are an Algonquin
speaking tribe; Menominee or “O-Maeq-No-Min-Ni-
Wuk” means People of the Wild Rice. They are divided
among five ancestral clans: Bear, Eagle, Wolf, Moose and Crane.
The Menominee are national lead-
ers in sustainable forestry practices.
Ninety-five percent of the reservation is
forested. It holds the finest old stands
of hardwood, pine and hemlock in the
Great Lakes basin. It is said that you
can see the outline of Menominee
County from space – the trees are that
much taller than the surrounding land-
scape. The combination of hardwoods
and evergreens makes for spectacular
fall colors.
Twenty-four miles of the Wolf River, a federally designated wild
river, flows through the reservation. Menominee County is a particu-
larly beautiful area – a remnant of pre-European Wisconsin – with 128
lakes and the Evergreen, Oconto, Red and Wolf Rivers found within its
borders. There are a dozen natural and cultural tourist attractions
located on the reservation. They include several beautiful waterfalls,
Spirit Rock, the Menominee Logging Museum, the College of the
Menominee Nation, and Menominee Casino & Bingo. There are also
cultural events that the public is invited to attend; consult the
Menominee web site for a schedule."

much more than that. The county is nearly square,
bisected east-to-west by Interstate-90.
In the northeast, the area around Warrens is
“Cranberry County.” Cranberries are the only fruit native
to Wisconsin. So, if God gives you cranberries, you make
cranberry juice... and Wisconsin now leads the nation in
the production of the tart, red berries for juice. You can
learn more about all things cranberry at the Wisconsin
Cranberry Discovery Center in Warrens (608/378-
4878, www.discovercranberries.com).
