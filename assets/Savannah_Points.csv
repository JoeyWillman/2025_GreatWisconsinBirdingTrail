Sauk,52. Aldo Leopold Legacy Center,0,"Leopold said, 'That land is a community is the basic concept of ecology, but that land is to be loved and respected is an extension of ethics.' He defined conservation as a way of life in which the land does well for its people, people do well by their land, and both end up better for the partnership. Today, the Leopold Center honors that ethic by demonstrating how a building can achieve carbon neutrality. Visitors learn more about Leopold, green building technology, and how to live lightly on the planet. Leopold’s best-known work, A Sand County Almanac has inspired generations to think naturally. <br><strong><br><strong><br><strong>Phone:</strong></strong></strong> 608/355-0279 <br><strong><br><strong><br><strong><br><strong>Website:</strong></strong> <a href=""https://"" target=""_blank"">https://</a><br> <a href=""https://aldoleopold.org"">aldoleopold.org</a> <br><strong><br><strong><br><strong>Gazetteer:</strong></strong> Page 43, D-6 (E13701 Levee Road) <br>Seasonality: Center is open Apr 14–Nov 1, Mon–Sat 10am–5pm; Oct 31–Apr 13, Mon–Sat 10am–4pm <br><strong><br><strong><br><strong>Parking:</strong></strong> Parking lot <br>Nearest food & lodging: Baraboo & Portage<br>",-89.644318,43.557879
