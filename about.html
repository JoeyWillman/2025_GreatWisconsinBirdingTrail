        <section class="mb-5">
            <h2>Welcome to Wild Wisconsin</h2>
            <p>Welcome to Wisconsin, where a wonderful world of wildlife watching awaits. With millions of acres of wild places, extensive wetlands, and a strong commitment to environmental stewardship, Wisconsin is an outstanding destination for birders and nature enthusiasts alike.</p>
            <p>The Great Wisconsin Birding and Nature Trail project divides the state into five wildlife-viewing regions. Each region features a driving trail linking unique waypoints, refuges, and wild places. Since 2004, a series of guides has been produced to highlight the best birding and wildlife watching opportunities across the state.</p>
        </section>

        <section class="mb-5">
            <h2>Purpose of the Trail</h2>
            <p>The Birding and Nature Trail is an invitation to explore the diverse ecosystems of Wisconsin. From the Apostle Islands in the north to Yellowstone State Park in the south, the trail helps travelers discover the best birding spots, wildlife viewing areas, and natural landscapes the state has to offer.</p>
            <p>Each trail site is marked by the program’s distinctive Sandhill Crane logo. Watch for these signs — they are your gateway to the fascinating world of Wisconsin wildlife.</p>
        </section>

        <section class="mb-5">
            <h2>Using the Guide</h2>
            <p>Site information was gathered locally from Wisconsin DNR staff, federal Forest Service personnel, naturalists, birders, and other wildlife experts. Each site listing typically includes:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Contact phone numbers</li>
                <li>Driving directions and locator maps</li>
                <li>Descriptions of the property</li>
                <li>Common and rare species to watch for</li>
                <li>Hours of operation and website links (when available)</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Many sites are remote and wild. For your safety, bring a county map or gazetteer, a compass, water, snacks, insect repellant, and sturdy walking shoes.</p>

            <h2>Code of Ethics</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Treat birds and wildlife with respect — never disturb or collect anything from their habitats.</li>
                <li>Stay on designated trails, roads, and paths unless in a wilderness area.</li>
                <li>Know where you are. Wisconsin has strict trespassing laws; private land does not have to be posted.</li>
                <li>Leash dogs on state lands during bird-nesting season (April 15 – July 31).</li>
                <li>Leave no trace. Keep sites litter-free and in good condition for others.</li>
                <li>Thank landowners, managers, and staff for providing access to these special places.</li>
            </ul>

        <section class="mb-5">
            <h2>State Natural Areas</h2>
            <p>Wisconsin’s State Natural Areas (SNAs) protect some of the finest examples of prairies, pine barrens, bogs, boreal forests, and other critical ecosystems. They also serve as vital refuges for rare and endangered plants, animals, and fungi, preserving the biological diversity that makes Wisconsin’s wild lands so special.</p>
