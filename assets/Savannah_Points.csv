Prior to becoming a state land, the marsh was farmed for the production of a native sedge known as Ãwire- grassÃ harvested to manufacture grass rugs.

At the turn of the century, the dam was removed to facilitate agricultural ventures that ultimately failed. The DNR began purchasing land here in 1948.
